    % matRad helper function that calculates the normal for a facet
    %
    % input
    %   fVals:          All input values of the convexHull
    %   k:              Array with the vertex indices of the facets
    %   i:              Index of the facet
    %
    % output
    %   facetPoints:    vertices of the hyperplane in objective space
    %   refPoint:       Reference Point, used to construct the hyperplane
    %   normal:         Normal of the facet
