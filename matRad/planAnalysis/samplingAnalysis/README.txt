In order to generate an automated uncertainty sampling report, do the following steps:

1. create empty folder to save your study
2. copy tools/samplingAnalysis/setupStudy_template.m (rename)
3. copy the already imported patient as a *.mat file into the directory
4. use appropriate parameters for uncertainty sampling
5. start matlab, add matRad root folder to the search path and run setupStudy.m

after succesful calculation, a pdf report will be generated and saved (studyPath/report/main.pdf)
