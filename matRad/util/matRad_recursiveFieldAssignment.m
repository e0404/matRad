function assigned = matRad_recursiveFieldAssignment(assignTo,reference,overwrite,fieldChangedWarningMessage,fieldname)
% matRad recursive field assignment tool
%   This function recursively assigns fields from one structure to another. If both 'assignTo' and 'reference' are structures,
% it will recurse into their fields. If a field in 'assignTo' is a structure and its corresponding field in 'reference' is not,
% or vice versa, a warning message is displayed. The function also handles the case where 'assignTo' or 'reference' are not structures,
% directly assigning the values. Custom warning messages can be specified for overwriting fields.
%
% call
%   assigned = matRad_recursiveFieldAssignment(assignTo,reference,fieldChangedWarningMessage,fieldname)
%
% input
%   assignTo:                      The initial structure to which the fields are to be assigned.
%   reference:                     The structure containing the fields and values to be assigned to 'assignTo'.
%   overwrite:                     Boolean flag that determines if the field value should be overwritten ( by defaults ) or preserved
%   fieldChangedWarningMessage:    Optional. A message to display if a field is overwritten. If not provided, no message is displayed.
%   fieldname:                     Optional. The name of the current field being processed. Used for generating specific warning messages.
%
% output
%   assigned:                      The structure 'assignTo' after assigning the fields from 'reference'.
