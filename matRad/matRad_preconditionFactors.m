% This is the dij scaling factor which will be applied during DAO.  It is
% given by the dividing the mean of the actual aperture weights by the
% bixel width.  This factor will divide all of the aperture weights.

% TODO: could probably integrate dijScaleFactor into jacobiScale. These
% were originally separated for research purposes. It would greatly
% simplify the code to have them all together.

            % to the current weight.
            % Next, multiply by the sqrt of ~approximately the number of
            % open bixels (slight modification to Esther Wild's formula).
