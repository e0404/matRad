function ct = matRad_calcWaterEqD(ct, radiationMode)
% matRad function to calculate the equivalent densities from a dicom ct 
% that originally uses intensity values
%
% call
%   ct = matRad_calcWaterEqD(ct, radiationMode)
%
% input
%   ct:             ct containing a cubeHU to compute rED/rSP values from
%   radiationMode:  radiationMode as character array (e.g. 'photons') since matRad 3.
%                   Can also be a pln-struct for downwards compatibility
%
% output
%   ct: ct struct with cube with relative _electron_ densities stored in
%   ct.cube
