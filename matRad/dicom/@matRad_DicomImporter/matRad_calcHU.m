function obj = matRad_calcHU(obj)
% matRad function to calculate Hounsfield units from a dicom ct 
% that originally uses intensity values
%
% In your object, there must be a property that contains unprocessed 
% dicom ct data which are stored as intensity values (IV)
%
% Output - ct structure with cube with HU
%
% HU = IV * slope + intercept
%
% call
%   obj = matRad_calcHU(obj)
