% The sequencing algorithm generates an a priori unkown number of apertures.
% We only want to keep a certain number of them (numToKeep).  These will be

% input
%   beam:               beam struct with shapes and weights only at the

%
% output
%   beam:               beam struct with shapes and weights distributed to
