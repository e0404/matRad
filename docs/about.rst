About |matRad_logo_header|
==========================

matRad is an open source software for radiation treatment planning of intensity-modulated photon, proton, and carbon ion therapy. matRad is developed for educational and research purposes. It is entirely written in `MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab>`_.

Please send us an `email <mailto:matrad@dkfz.de?Subject=matRad newsletter>`_ if you want to receive the matRad newsletter that informs about the latest developments on an irregular basis.

Features
--------

matRad comprises:

- MATLAB functions to model the entire treatment planning workflow
- Example patient data
- Physical and biological base data for all required computations

In particular, we provide functionalities for:

- Ray tracing
- Photon dose calculation
- Proton dose calculation (constant + variable RBE modeling)
- Carbon/helium ion dose calculation (including 3D RBE modeling)
- Inverse planning (based on physical dose and biological effect)
- Multileaf collimator sequencing
- Basic treatment plan visualization and evaluation

matRad is constantly evolving. If you are looking for a special feature, do not hesitate and `get in touch <mailto:matrad@dkfz.de?Subject=matRad>`_.

Contact
-------

If you have any questions or wish to contribute to the development of matRad, you can either write an email to `matrad@dkfz.de <mailto:matrad@dkfz.de>`_, use the GitHub functionalities to file a new issue, or directly fork the matRad repository and send pull requests with your own custom developments. What are you waiting for?

Development team
----------------

matRad development is driven by the research group `Radiotherapy Optimization <http://www.dkfz.de/radopt>`_ within the `Division of Medical Physics in Radiation Oncology <http://www.dkfz.de/en/medphys>`_ at the `German Cancer Research Center DKFZ <http://www.dkfz.de>`_ in `Heidelberg <https://goo.gl/maps/BBo2E>`_. 

We are always looking for beta testers that can provide external feedback on our code and developers that would like to take an active role in the future. Do not hesitate and `get in touch <mailto:contact@matrad.org>`_.
