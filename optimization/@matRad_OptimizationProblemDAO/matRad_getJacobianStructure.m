% --> gives me a matrix with number of rows = num of constraints and tells
% me in th columns if a beamlet has an influence on this constraint

% for apertures I need to check if the very beam orientation of the aperture has a bixel
% that potentially influences the constraint

% for leaves I need to check if that particular leaf row has bixels that
% potentially influence the objective which works via apertureInfo.beam(i).bixelIndMap

% all stuff can be done per beam direction and then I use repmat to build
% up the big matrix
