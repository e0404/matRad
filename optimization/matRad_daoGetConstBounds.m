% matRad IPOPT get constraint bounds function for direct aperture optimization

%
% input
%   cst:            matRad cst struct
%   apertureInfo:   aperture info struct
%   numOfScenarios: number of scenarios considered
%   type:           type of optimizaiton; either 'none','effect' or 'RBExD'
%
% output
%   cl: lower bounds on constraints
