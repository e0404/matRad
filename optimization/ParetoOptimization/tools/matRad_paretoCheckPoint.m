function dominatedPoints = matRad_paretoCheckPoint(fVals,newfVal)
% matRad helper function that checks if a newly generated point dominates
% another point or is dominated by a point in the previous sets. should
% be called after calculating the first initial points 
%
%
% input
%   fVals:              The so-far determined pareto optimal points 
%   newfVal:            New point to check against fVals
%
% output
%   dominatedPoints:    0 if new point dominated by point in previous set
%                       empty if new point neither dominates a point in old set or is dominated by point in old set
%                       otherwise array refering to the indices of points
%                       in the old set dominated by the newly calculated
%                       point
