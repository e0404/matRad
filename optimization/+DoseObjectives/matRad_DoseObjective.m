classdef (Abstract) matRad_DoseObjective < matRad_DoseOptimizationFunction
% matRad_DoseObjective: Interface for optimization objectives
%   This abstract base class provides the structure of optimization
%   objectives like mean dose, squared deviation, EUD, dose-volume etc.
%   Implementations can be found in the DoseObjectives package
