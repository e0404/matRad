function [sigmaIni] = matRad_calcSigmaIni(baseData,rays,SSD)
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function evaluates simultaneously the initial sigma of the beam for
% one or more energies
%
% call
%   sigmaIni = matRad_calcSigmaIni(machine.data,stf(i).ray,stf(i).ray(j).SSD);
%
% input
%   baseData:           'machine.data' file
%   rays:            	'stf.ray' file
%   SSD:                source-surface difference
%
% output
%   sigmaIni:        	initial sigma of the ray at certain energy (or
%                       energies). The data is given in 1xP dimensions,
%                       where 'P' represents the number of different
%                       energies
