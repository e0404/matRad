% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This function projects a point on a certain ray and returns both the index
% of the projected point in the reference system of the ct cube and its
% coordinates

%           matRad_projectOnComponents(initIx,dim,sourcePoint_bev,targetPoint_bev,isoCenter, res, Dx, Dz, rotMat)
%
% input
%   initIx:             initial indices of the points
%   cubeDim:            dimension of the ct cube (i.e. ct.cubeDim)

%   targetPoint_bev:    target point of the ray in bev
%   isoCenter:          isocenter coordinates

%   Dx:                 displacement on x axis
%   Dz:                 displacement on z axis
