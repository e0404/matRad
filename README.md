# General information

---

matRad is an open source treatment planning system for radiation therapy written in Matlab. It is meant for educational and research purposes and supports planning of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for mutliple modalities. The source code is maintained by a development team at the German Cancer Reserach Center DKFZ in Heidelberg, Germany, and other contributors around the world. We are always looking for more people willing to help improve matRad. Do not hesitate and [get in touch](mailto:matrad@dkfz.de).

More information can be found on the project page  at <http://e0404.github.io/matRad/>; a wiki documentation is under constant development at <https://github.com/e0404/matRad/wiki>.
