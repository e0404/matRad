# General information

---

matRad is an open source treatment planning system for radiation therapy
written in Matlab. It is meant for educational purposes and supports 
planning of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for mutliple 
modalities. The source code is maintained by a development team at the 
German Cancer Reserach Center DKFZ in Heidelberg, Germany, and other
contributors around the world. We are always looking for more people
willing to help improve matRad. Do not hesitate and get in touch.

More information can be found on the project page  at <http://e0404.github.io/matRad/>; a wiki documentation is under constant development at <https://github.com/e0404/matRad/wiki>.
