function ct = matRad_calcWaterEqD(ct, pln)
% matRad function to calculate the equivalent densities from a dicom ct 
% that originally uses intensity values
%
% call
%   ct = matRad_calcWaterEqD(ct, pln)
%
% input
%   ct: unprocessed dicom ct data which are stored as intensity values (IV)
%
%       HU = IV * slope + intercept
%
%   pln: matRad plan struct
%
% output
%   ct: ct struct with cube with relative _electron_ densities
