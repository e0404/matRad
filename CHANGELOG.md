# Changelog

## Version 3.1.0 - "Cleve"

### Major Changes and New Features

#### File Structure Overhaul 
- Major restructuring of files into organized subfolders, such as matRad (core code), thirdParty, examples, etc., to improve clarity and maintainability.
- Introduction of userdata folder to maintain custom data

#### Scenario Management and robust / 4D optimization
- Introduced comprehensive scenario management (scenario models), including support for 4D phase scenarios and automated scenario model instance tests.
- Multiple robust optimization methods (COWC, OWC, VWWC, expected value) 

#### Object-Oriented DoseEngines & new Monte Carlo interfaces 
- Transitioned from procedural dose calculation to an object-oriented approach, significantly improving the structure and maintainability of the dose engines.
- Added customizable TOPAS interface for ions (and experimental for photons)
- Workflow of the existing Monte Carlo interfaces has been completely overhauled in the new engine format
- New handling of coordinate system (separation into world / cube systems with dedicated transformation functions) to ease readability
- Recalculated proton_Generic machine with stored phase space parameterization to facilitate consistent MC / PB calculations.

#### Helium planning
- matRad now contains a Generic helium dataset including LET
- LET-based Helium model

#### Extended biological modeling
- Multiple variable RBE models for protons and helium added with an Object-oriented Datamodel Architecture
- BED optimization

#### Widget-Based GUI
- Replaced Matlab's GUIDE-based approach with a modern widget-based GUI.
- Large parts of the GUI are now Octave Compatible
- Light & Dark Mode

#### DICOM Exporter and Importer
- added a DICOM exporter for CTs, RTStruct, RTPlan (photons, safeguarded) and RTDose
- Refactored the DICOM importer for better use from scripts

#### Possibly (and probably) Breaking Changes to matRad core workflow and functions
While we try to keep downwards compatibility (and will provide fixes if breaking changes are detected), here are some potential/probable dealbreakers
- The coordinate handling of the isocenter changed. The isocenter is now always given in "world" coordinates (i.e., corresponding to the ct plane coordintes). Before, the isocenter resided in its own "cube" coordinate system (voxel index * resolution)
- Some other coordinate system bug-fixes might induce changes when an existing script is rerun
- Default configuration options now stored in MatRad_Config under "defaults" struct. There is a compatibility layer, but this might break under user changes
- Changed matRad_calcCubes to accept a variety of different fields for Monte Carlo, without changing the current usage
- Biological Models are defined in a completely different way now and downwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
- The object oriented scenario models and biological models could procude issues in old scripts if matRad can not infer the models
- While the old dose calculation functions have been kept in a compatibility / deprecation layer, some configuration options might not work as intended

### Other Enhancements, Documentation, and Testing

#### New unit-testing framework
- Introduced Usage of MOxUnit and MOcov for automated unit tests (and the example tests). They are included as submodules.
- Unit tests now runnig as GitHub Actions on Matlab R2022b, the latest release, and Octave 6

#### Improved Octave Compatibility:
- Compatibility tested for Octave 6 to 9. 
- Octave compatibility not always optimal, and IPOPT needs to be compiled individually.

#### Performance Improvements & Code Cleanup
- Performance improvements and updates on interpolation
- Performance improvements in optimization
- Code cleanup for consistent use of MatRad_Config's error / warning / logging mechanism.

### Bug Fixes
- *Compilation Fixes:* Resolved issues with ompMC mex file compilation and Octave compatibility warnings.
- Corrected path issues and file handling, especially for temporary directories and submodules.
- Fixed some bugs in optimization objectives & constraints for special input cases
- Fixed issues in DICOM import expecting non-standard tags

### Semantic Versioning
- Starting from major version 3.*, matRad will follow rigorous semantic versioning in a major.minor.patch style
  - **Major:** Major releases include major new features (e.g. a new modality) and/or do not guarantee downwards compatibility of the top-level API, which we consider calls to all functions on the top-level of the "matRad" folder. Since a lot of configuration of these functions can be done per `pln.prop*` and other propertie sin `pln`, this might happen more quickly than one might think.
  - **Minor:** Minor releases incldue minor new features (e.g. a new optimizer, objectives, biomodel or dose calculation algorithm). Downwards compatibility (within the major release) is preserved.
  - **Patch:** Patch versions only fix bugs and do not introduce new features. Exceptions could be the exposure of new, minimal configuration options to mitigate a bug occuring in special circumstances.

## Version 2.10.1 - Patch release for "Blaise" 
Release with small updates, clean-ups and bugfixes    
- Bugfix in 3D view due to inconsistent angles in pln & stf
- Bugfix for using incorrect dicom UID's and wrong writing order in the dicom export
- Bugfix for weird colormap issue in plotting
- New handling of environment checking with matRad_cfg (old function is still working)
- Code documentation update
- Remove hardcoded penumbra width in photon dose calculation -> can now be stored in machine file (machine.data.penumbraFWHMatIso)
- Update to ompMC to use virtual Gaussian source (uses measured penumbra value) incld precompiled mex files
- Remove useless global statements before matRad_cfg
- Add blue/white/red difference map to colormaps (in the correct way)
- Updated TravisCI testing (Sped up by using pre-compiled mex interfaces and including testing with Matlab (on Ubuntu), Azure DevOps as fallback
- Github gimmicks added: Stalebot, Issue & PR Templates
- Code optimization for jacobian evaluation (x10-100 speedup)
- New option pln.propDoseCalc.useGivenEqDensityCube (default false) to directly use the literal values from ct.cube and omit HU to WEQ conversion from ct.cubeHU
- New option pln.propDoseCalc.ignoreOutsideDensities (default true) to disable/enable inclusion of WEPL outside the patient contour in ray-tracing

## Version 2.10.0 - "Blaise"
