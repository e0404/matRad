# Userdata folder

This folder can be used to store user-importet patients (in the patients folder), Hounsfield-Unit look-up tables (hluts folder) or user-configured machines (machine folder). Files in this folder will be automatically added to the matRad search paths. Using `matRad_rc` with the argument `-addUserFolder pathToFolder` other folders can be added following the same naming scheme and subfolder scheme.
