# Folder for user-configured Hounsfield-Unit LookUp-Tables

This folder can be used to store custom Hounsfield LookUp-Tables (HU -> rSP, HU -> rED). HLUTs in here will be added on to the search path once `matRad_rc` is run and subsequently recognized in matRad, but will by default be ignored within git.
For the format of a user-defined ASCII *.hlut files check-out the default HLUTs stored in matRad/hluts and follow the naming scheme explained in the Wiki.
