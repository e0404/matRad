### Bug description
Describe the new feature you want to contribute and reference respective issues if this specific enhancement was asked for.

### Approach
Describe how you implemented the feature:
- How does my feature change matRad code?
- Are there any new parameters associated with the feature that need to be documented? (maybe think about providing defaults in MatRad_Config)
- Are there external dependencies (toolboxes, mex files, etc.)?

### Open Questions and/or Concerns
Use a github checklists to adress any concerns like. e.g.
- [ ] I wasn't sure about this or that variable and if I did the correct thing with it
- [ ] I am not sure if this is compatible with the latest Matlab version
- [ ] etc.
This self-defined checklist then has to be checked before merge by reviewers and yourself.
