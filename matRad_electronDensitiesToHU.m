function ct = matRad_electronDensitiesToHU(ct)
% matRad function to calculate recalculate HU values from equivalent densities 
% This is done to provide downward compatability to previous matRad 
% versions where HU values were not automatically saved during the
% import process. HU values can only be calculated if the HLUT is
% bijective.
%
% call
%   ct = matRad_electronDensitiesToHU(ct)
%
% input
%   ct: matRad ct struct containing cube and all additional information
%
% output
%   ct: ct struct with HU and equivalent density cube
