{"name":"matRad","tagline":"An open source multi-modality radiation treatment planning sytem","body":"matRad is an open source software for radiation treatment planning of intensity-modulated photon, proton, and carbon ion therapy. matRad is developed for educational and research purposes; it is entirely written in [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nmatRad comprises\r\n* a set of MATLAB functions to model the entire treatment planning workflow,\r\n* example patient data, and \r\n* base data for all required computations.\r\n\r\nIn particular. we provide functionalities for\r\n* Ray tracing\r\n* Photon dose calculation\r\n* Proton dose calculation\r\n* Carbon ion dose calculation\r\n* Inverse planning\r\n* Multileaf collimator sequencing\r\n* Treatment plan visualization and evaluation\r\n\r\nmatRad is constantly evolving. If you are looking for a special feature do not hesitate and get in touch.\r\n\r\n## Development team\r\nmatRad development is driven by the research group [Optimization Algorithms](http://www.dkfz.de/radopt) within the [Division of Medical Physics in Radiation Oncology](http://www.dkfz.de/en/medphys) at the [German Cancer Research Center DKFZ](http://www.dkfz.de) in [Heidelberg](https://goo.gl/maps/BBo2E). Contributors at the German Cancer Research Center and beyond include\r\n* Mark Bangert ([DKFZ](http://www.dkfz.de))\r\n* Eduardo Cisternas ([DKFZ](http://www.dkfz.de))\r\n* Andrea Mairani ([CNAO](http://www.cnao.it/)/[HIT](http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/Welcome.113005.0.html?&L=1))\r\n* Peter Ziegenhein ([ICR](http://www.icr.ac.uk/))\r\n* Thomas Klinge ([DKFZ](http://www.dkfz.de))\r\n* Oliver Jäkel ([DKFZ](http://www.dkfz.de)/[HIT](http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/Welcome.113005.0.html?&L=1)/[Heidelberg University Clinic](http://www.heidelberg-university-hospital.com/Radiation-Therapy.137.0.html))\r\n\r\nWe are actively looking for beta testers that can provide external feedback on our code and developers that would like to take an active role in the future. Do not hesitate and get in touch.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or wish to contribute to the development of matRad you can either write an email to the user m.bangert at the domain dkfz.de, use the GitHub functionalities to file a new issue, or directly fork the matRad repository and send pull requests with your own custom developments.
