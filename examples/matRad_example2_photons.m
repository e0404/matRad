% In this example we will show 
% (i) how to load patient data into matRad
% (ii) how to setup a photon dose calculation and 
% (iii) how to inversely optimize beamlet intensities
% (iv) how to visually and quantitatively evaluate the result

%% Patient Data Import
% Let's begin with a clear Matlab environment. Then, import the TG119
% phantom into your workspace. The phantom is comprised of a 'ct' and 'cst'
% structure defining the CT images and the structure set. Make sure the 
% matRad root directory with all its subdirectories is added to the Matlab 
% search path.

matRad_rc; %If this throws an error, run it from the parent directory first to set the paths

load('TG119.mat');

%%
% The file TG119.mat contains two Matlab variables. Let's check what we 
% have just imported. First, the 'ct' variable comprises the ct cube along
%with some meta information describing properties of the ct cube (cube 
% dimensions, resolution, number of CT scenarios). Please note that 
%multiple ct cubes (e.g. 4D CT) can be stored in the cell array ct.cube{}
display(ct);

%%
% The 'cst' cell array defines volumes of interests along with information 
% required for optimization. Each row belongs to one certain volume of 
% interest (VOI), whereas each column defines different properties. 
% Specifically, the second and third column  show the name and the type of 
% the structure. The type can be set to OAR, TARGET or IGNORED. The fourth 
% column contains a linear index vector that lists all voxels belonging to 
% a certain VOI.
display(cst);

%%
% The fifth column represents meta parameters for optimization. The overlap
% priority is used to resolve ambiguities of overlapping structures (voxels 
% belonging to multiple structures will only be assigned to the VOI(s) with
% the highest overlap priority, i.e.. the lowest value). The parameters 
% alphaX and betaX correspond to the tissue's photon-radiosensitivity 
% parameter of the linear quadratic model. These parameter are required for
% biological treatment planning using a variable RBE. Let's output the meta 
% optimization parameter of the target, which is stored in the thrid row:
ixTarget = 3;
display(cst{ixTarget,5});

%%
% The sixth column contains optimization information such as objectives and
% constraints which are required to calculate the objective function value. 
% Please note, that multiple objectives/constraints can be defined for
% individual structures. Here, we have defined a squared deviation 
% objective making it 'expensive/costly' for the optimizer to over- and 
% underdose the target structure (both are equally important). 
display(cst{ixTarget,6});

%% Treatment Plan
% The next step is to define your treatment plan labeled as 'pln'. This 
% matlab structure requires input from the treatment planner and defines 
% the most important cornerstones of your treatment plan.

%%
% First of all, we need to define what kind of radiation modality we would
% like to use. Possible values are photons, protons or carbon. In this case
% we want to use photons. Then, we need to define a treatment machine to 
% correctly load the corresponding base data. matRad includes base data for
% generic photon linear accelerator called 'Generic'. By this means matRad 
% will look for 'photons_Generic.mat' in our root directory and will use 
% the data provided in there for dose calculation
pln.radiationMode = 'photons';  
pln.machine       = 'Generic';

%%
% Define the flavor of optimization along with the quantity that should be
% used for optimization. Possible values are (none: physical optimization; 
% const_RBExD: constant RBE of 1.1; LEMIV_effect: effect-based 
% optimization; LEMIV_RBExD: optimization of RBE-weighted dose. As we are 
% using photons, we simply set the parameter to 'none' thereby indicating 
% the physical dose should be optimized.
pln.propOpt.bioOptimization = 'none';    

%%
% Now we have to set some beam parameters. We can define multiple beam 
% angles for the treatment and pass these to the plan as a vector. matRad 
% will then interpret the vector as multiple beams. In this case, we define
% linear spaced beams from 0 degree to 359 degree in 40 degree steps. This 
% results in 9 beams. All corresponding couch angles are set to 0 at this 
% point. Moreover, we set the bixelWidth to 5, which results in a beamlet 
% size of 5 x 5 mm in the isocenter plane. The number of fractions is set 
% to 30. Internally, matRad considers the fraction dose for optimization, 
% however, objetives and constraints are defined for the entire treatment.
pln.numOfFractions         = 30;
pln.propStf.gantryAngles   = [0:40:359];
pln.propStf.couchAngles    = zeros(1,numel(pln.propStf.gantryAngles));
pln.propStf.bixelWidth     = 5;

%%
% Obtain the number of beams and voxels from the existing variables and 
% calculate the iso-center which is per default the center of gravity of 
% all target voxels.
pln.propStf.numOfBeams      = numel(pln.propStf.gantryAngles);
pln.propStf.isoCenter       = ones(pln.propStf.numOfBeams,1) * matRad_getIsoCenter(cst,ct,0);

%% dose calculation settings
% set resolution of dose calculation and optimization
pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.x = 3; % [mm]
pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.y = 3; % [mm]
pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.z = 3; % [mm]

%%
% Enable sequencing and disable direct aperture optimization (DAO) for now.
% A DAO optimization is shown in a seperate example.
pln.propOpt.runSequencing = 1;
pln.propOpt.runDAO        = 0;

%%
% and et voila our treatment plan structure is ready. Lets have a look:
display(pln);

%% Generate Beam Geometry STF
% The steering file struct comprises the complete beam geometry along with 
% ray position, pencil beam positions and energies, source to axis distance (SAD) etc.
stf = matRad_generateStf(ct,cst,pln);

%%
% Let's display the beam geometry information of the 6th beam
display(stf(6));

%% Dose Calculation
% Let's generate dosimetric information by pre-computing dose influence 
% matrices for unit beamlet intensities. Having dose influences available 
% allows subsequent inverse optimization.
dij = matRad_calcPhotonDose(ct,stf,pln,cst);

%% Inverse Optimization for IMRT
% The goal of the fluence optimization is to find a set of beamlet/pencil 
% beam weights which yield the best possible dose distribution according to
% the clinical objectives and constraints underlying the radiation 
% treatment. Once the optimization has finished, trigger once the GUI to 
% visualize the optimized dose cubes.
resultGUI = matRad_fluenceOptimization(dij,cst,pln);
matRadGUI;

%% Plot the Resulting Dose Slice
% Let's plot the transversal iso-center dose slice
slice = round(pln.propStf.isoCenter(1,3)./ct.resolution.z);
figure
imagesc(resultGUI.physicalDose(:,:,slice)),colorbar, colormap(jet);

%% Now let's create another treatment plan but this time use a coarser beam spacing.
% Instead of 40 degree spacing use a 50 degree geantry beam spacing
pln.propStf.gantryAngles = [0:50:359];
pln.propStf.couchAngles  = zeros(1,numel(pln.propStf.gantryAngles));
pln.propStf.numOfBeams   = numel(pln.propStf.gantryAngles);
stf                      = matRad_generateStf(ct,cst,pln);
pln.propStf.isoCenter    = vertcat(stf.isoCenter);
dij                      = matRad_calcPhotonDose(ct,stf,pln,cst);
resultGUI_coarse         = matRad_fluenceOptimization(dij,cst,pln);

%%  Visual Comparison of results
% Let's compare the new recalculation against the optimization result.
% Check if you have added all subdirectories to the Matlab search path,
% otherwise it will not find the plotting function
plane      = 3;
doseWindow = [0 max([resultGUI.physicalDose(:); resultGUI_coarse.physicalDose(:)])];

figure,title('original plan - fine beam spacing')
matRad_plotSliceWrapper(gca,ct,cst,1,resultGUI.physicalDose,plane,slice,[],0.75,colorcube,[],doseWindow,[]);
figure,title('modified plan - coarse beam spacing')
matRad_plotSliceWrapper(gca,ct,cst,1,resultGUI_coarse.physicalDose,plane,slice,[],0.75,colorcube,[],doseWindow,[]);

%% 
% At this point we would like to see the absolute difference of the first 
% optimization (finer beam spacing) and the second optimization (coarser 
% beam spacing)
absDiffCube = resultGUI.physicalDose-resultGUI_coarse.physicalDose;
figure,title( 'fine beam spacing plan - coarse beam spacing plan')
matRad_plotSliceWrapper(gca,ct,cst,1,absDiffCube,plane,slice,[],[],colorcube);

%% Obtain dose statistics
% Two more columns will be added to the cst structure depicting the DVH and
% standard dose statistics such as D95,D98, mean dose, max dose etc.
[dvh,qi]               = matRad_indicatorWrapper(cst,pln,resultGUI);
[dvh_coarse,qi_coarse] = matRad_indicatorWrapper(cst,pln,resultGUI_coarse);

%%
% The treatment plan using more beams should in principle result in a
% better OAR sparing. Therefore lets have a look at the D95 of the OAR of 
% both plans
ixOAR = 2;
display(qi(ixOAR).D_95);
display(qi_coarse(ixOAR).D_95);


%% 
% Export the dose in binary format. matRad can write multiple formats, here we 
% choose to export in nrrd format using the matRad_writeCube function, which 
% chooses the appropriate subroutine from the extension. The metadata struct can
% also store more optional parameters, but requires only the resolution to be s
% set.
metadata = struct('resolution',[ct.resolution.x ct.resolution.y ct.resolution.z]);
matRad_writeCube([pwd filesep 'photonDose_example2.nrrd'],resultGUI.physicalDose,'double',metadata);
