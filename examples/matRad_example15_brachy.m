%% List of contents
% In this example we will show 
% (i) how to load patient data into matRad
% (ii) how to setup an HDR brachy dose calculation and 
% (iii) how to inversely optimize holding position intensties
% (iv) how to visually and quantitatively evaluate the result
% (v) how to verify that functions do the right thing

%% I Patient Data Import
% Let's begin with a clear Matlab environment. Then, import the TG119
% phantom into your workspace. The phantom is comprised of a 'ct' and 'cst'
% structure defining the CT images and the structure set. Make sure the 
% matRad root directory with all its subdirectories is added to the Matlab 
% search path.

matRad_rc;
load 'PROSTATE.mat';

%% I - update/set dose objectives for brachytherapy
% The sixth column represents dose objectives and constraints for
% optimization: First, the objective function for the individual structure
% is chosen, its parameters denote doses that should not be tranceeded
% towards higher or lower doses (SquaredOverdose, SquaredUnderdose) or
% doses that are particularly aimed for (SquaredUnderDose).

display(cst{6,6}{1});

% Following frequently prescribed planning doses of 15 Gy
% (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22559663/) objectives can be updated to:

% the planning target was changed to the clinical segmentation of the
% prostate bed.
cst{5,3}    = 'TARGET';
cst{5,6}{1} = struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_SquaredUnderdosing(100,15));
cst{5,6}{2} = struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_SquaredOverdosing(100,17.5));
cst{6,5}.Priority = 1;

% In this example, the lymph nodes will not be part of the treatment:
cst{7,6}    =  [];
cst{7,3}    =  'OAR';

%A PTV is not needed, but we will use it to control the dose fall off
cst{6,3}    =  'OAR';
cst{6,6}{1} =  struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_SquaredOverdosing(100,12));
cst{6,5}.Priority = 2;

% Rectum Objective
cst{1,6}{1} = struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_SquaredOverdosing(10,7.5));

% Bladder Objective
cst{8,6}{1} = struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_SquaredOverdosing(10,7.5));

% Body NT objective
cst{9,6}{1} = struct(DoseObjectives.matRad_MeanDose(1));


%% II.1 Treatment Plan
% The next step is to define your treatment plan labeled as 'pln'. This 
% matlab structure requires input from the treatment planner and defines 
% the most important cornerstones of your treatment plan.

% First of all, we need to define what kind of radiation modality we would
% like to use. Possible values are photons, protons or carbon 
% (external beam) or brachy as an invasive tratment option.
% In this case we want to use brachytherapy. Then, we need to define a 
% treatment machine to correctly load the corresponding base data.
% matRad includes example base data for HDR and LDR brachytherapy.
% Here we will use HDR. By this means matRad will look for 'brachy_HDR.mat'
% in our root directory and will use the data provided in there for 
% dose calculation.

pln.radiationMode   = 'brachy'; 
pln.machine         = 'HDR';    % 'LDR' or 'HDR' for brachy

quantityOpt    = 'physicalDose';                                     
modelName      = 'none';  

% retrieve bio model parameters
pln.bioParam = matRad_bioModel(pln.radiationMode,quantityOpt, modelName);

% retrieve scenarios for dose calculation and optimziation
pln.multScen = matRad_multScen(ct,'nomScen');
% dose calculation settings
%Choose BT Engine
pln.propDoseCalc.engine = 'TG43';



%% II.1 - needle and template geometry
% Now we have to set some parameters for the template and the needles. 
% Let's start with the needles: Seed distance is the distance between
% two neighbouring seeds or holding points on one needle or catheter. The
% seeds No denotes how many seeds/holding points there are per needle.

pln.propStf.needle.seedDistance      = 10; % [mm] 
pln.propStf.needle.seedsNo           = 6; 

%% II.1 - template position
% The implantation is normally done through a 13 x 13 template from the 
% patients inferior, which is the negative z axis here.
% The direction of the needles is defined by template normal.
% Neighbour distances are called by bixelWidth, because this field is also
% used for external beam therapy.
% The needles will be positioned right under the target volume pointing up.


pln.propStf.bixelWidth   = 5; % [mm] template grid distance
pln.propStf.templateRoot = matRad_getTemplateRoot(ct,cst); % mass center of
% target in x and y and bottom in z

% Here, we define active needles as 1 and inactive needles
% as 0. This is the x-y plane and needles point in z direction. 
% A checkerboard pattern is frequantly used. The whole geometry will become
% clearer when it is displayed in 3D view in the next section.

%% II.1 - dose calculation options
% for dose calculation we use eather the 2D or the 1D formalism proposed by
% TG 43. Also, set resolution of dose calculation and optimization.
% If your system gets stuck with the resolution, you can lower it to 10 or
% 20, just to get an initial result. Otherwise, reduce the number of
% needles.
% Calculation time will be reduced by one tenth when we define a dose
% cutoff distance.


pln.propDoseCalc.TG43approximation = '2D'; %'1D' or '2D' 

pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.x = 5; % [mm]
pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.y = 5; % [mm]
pln.propDoseCalc.doseGrid.resolution.z = 5; % [mm]



% We can also use other solver for optimization than IPOPT. matRad 
% currently supports simulannealbnd from the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox. First we
% check if the simulannealbnd-Solver is available, and if it is, we set in in the
% pln.propOpt.optimizer varirable. Otherwise we set to the default
% optimizer 'IPOPT'
if matRad_OptimizerSimulannealbnd.IsAvailable()
    pln.propOpt.optimizer = 'simulannealbnd';   
else
    pln.propOpt.optimizer = 'IPOPT';
end
%% II.1 - book keeping
% Some field names have to be kept although they don't have a direct
% relevance for brachy therapy.
pln.propOpt.bioOptimization = 'none';
pln.propOpt.runDAO          = false;  
pln.propOpt.runSequencing   = false; 
pln.propStf.gantryAngles    = []; 
pln.propStf.couchAngles     = []; 
pln.propStf.numOfBeams      = 0;
pln.numOfFractions          = 1; 

%% II.1 - view plan
% Et voila! Our treatment plan structure is ready. Lets have a look:
display(pln);


%% II.2 Steering Seed Positions From STF
% The steering file struct contains all needls/catheter geometry with the
% target volume, number of needles, seeds and the positions of all needles
% The one in the end enables visualization.

stf = matRad_generateStf(ct,cst,pln,1);

%% II.2 - view stf
% The 3D view is interesting, but we also want to know how the stf struct
% looks like.

display(stf)

%% II.3 - Dose Calculation
% Let's generate dosimetric information by pre-computing a dose influence 
% matrix for seed/holding point intensities. Having dose influences
% available allows subsequent inverse optimization.
% Don't get inpatient, this can take a few seconds...

dij = matRad_calcDoseInfluence(ct,cst,stf,pln);

%% III Inverse Optimization for brachy therapy
% The goal of the fluence optimization is to find a set of holding point
% times which yield the best possible dose distribution according to
% the clinical objectives and constraints underlying the radiation 
% treatment. Once the optimization has finished, trigger to 
% visualize the optimized dose cubes.

resultGUI = matRad_fluenceOptimization(dij,cst,pln);
matRadGUI;

%% IV.1 Plot the Resulting Dose Slice
% Let's plot the transversal iso-center dose slice

slice = matRad_world2cubeIndex(pln.propStf.isoCenter(1,:),ct);
slice = slice(3);
figure
imagesc(resultGUI.physicalDose(:,:,slice)),colorbar, colormap(jet);

%% IV.2 Obtain dose statistics
% Two more columns will be added to the cst structure depicting the DVH and
% standard dose statistics such as D95,D98, mean dose, max dose etc.
[dvh,qi]               = matRad_indicatorWrapper(cst,pln,resultGUI);
