% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% matRad function to interpolate a 3D ct cube to a different resolution
% 
% call
%   interpCt = matRad_interpCtCube(origCt, origCtInfo, resolution)
%
% input
%   origCt:         original CT as matlab 3D array
%   origCtInfo:     meta information about the geometry of the orgiCt cube
%   resolution:     target resolution [mm] in x, y, an z direction for the 
%                   new cube
%
% output
%   interpCt:       interpolated ct cube as matlab 3D array
